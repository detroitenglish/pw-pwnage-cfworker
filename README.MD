# Enlist a Cloudflare Worker as your Secure Password Scoring and Pwnage Protection API

(Prefer serverless? [See the AWS Lambda version here](https://github.com/detroitenglish/haveibeenpwned-zxcvbn-lambda-api))

Deploy a private, secure and serverless RESTful endpoint for sanely scoring users' new passwords using Dropbox's [`zxcvbn`](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) library while (k-)anonymously querying Troy Hunt's [`haveibeenpwned`](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) collection of +5.1 *billion* breached accounts.

## Motivation
<a href="https://twitter.com/DetroitEnglish/status/1008276231199055874" target="_blank">People seemed to think this concept was neat</a>, and a tiny RESTful API like this is a perfect use case for a mighty little [**Cloudflare Worker**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

As a bonus, [over 90%](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1011871596603060225) of `pwnedpassword` queries are already cached on and served from Cloudflare's edge, making our response times _spooky_ fast! üëª


---

## Quick Start

1. Rename `example.cloudflare.env` to `cloudflare.env` and edit the configuration as needed.
2. Install deps with `npm install`
3. Launch üöÄ with `npm run deploy`

### Configuration

The following options are configurable via `cloudflare.env`:

- `ROUTE_PATTERN`: Optionally include a route-matching pattern for your worker. Note that this will disable any other enabled patterns that (default: `undefined`)

- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`: Whitelisted origin for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. If not provided, all origins are allowed (default: `*`)

- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN_PATTERNS`: Comma-seperated list of strings to be converted to `RegExp` patterns for testing the incoming request origin. If the origin matches, it's returned as allowed. If no pattern is matched, CORS falls back to the configured `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` (default: `undefined`)
    - Example: `"(foo|bar|buzz)\.example\.lol,yet\.another\.example\.omg"`

- `CORS_MAXAGE`: Value in seconds for the `Access-Control-Max-Age` CORS header (default: `"300"`)

- `ALWAYS_RETURN_SCORE`: Return the `zxcvbn` score even if the `pwnedpasswords` match value is > 0. See [Response](#Response) for details (default: `undefined`, thereby `false`)

- `CUSTOM_PW_DICT`: Comma-seperated list of words/phrases to be included in the `zxcvbn` strength estimation dictionary. It's a good idea to include e.g. your company or application name here (default: `''`)

- `RETURN_PW_METADATA`: Return the full result of the `zxcvbn` strength estimation as a `metadata` response key. Refer to the [zxcvbn documentation](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn#usage) for details on what that includes (default: `undefined`, thereby `false`)

### Updating

Update configuration √† la changes to `cloudflare.env` by re-running `npm run deploy`.

**NOTE**: For reasons unknown, the Cloudflare Dash may continue to show older scripts after a successful upload. Check the `x-worker-last-modified` response header to verify that your latest script is up and running.

### Request

POST user password input to your route as JSON with field `password` like so:

```javascript
// pwned password
{
  "password": "monkey123"
}
```
```javascript
// stronger password
{
  "password": "wonderful waffles"
}
```

### Response

Our little worker-bro will reply with an appropriate status code, and JSON body with `ok` indicating successful scoring and range search, a strength estimation `score` of 0 through 4 per `zxcvbn`, and `pwned` matches, indicating the number times the input appears in the `haveibeenpwned` database.

```javascript
// pwned password 'monkey123'
{
    "ok": true,
    "score": 0,
    "pwned": 56491
}
```
```javascript
// stronger password 'wonderful waffles'
{
    "ok": true,
    "score": 3,
    "pwned": 0
}
```
By default, if `pwned` is greater than 0, then `score` will **always** be 0. You can override this behavior by settings `"ALWAYS_RETURN_SCORE"` to `true` in `cloudflare.env`

If `RETURN_PW_METADATA` is truthy, responses will also include a `metadata` key with the complete `zxcvbn` [strength estimation result object](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn#usage).

Each response will also contain a `x-worker-last-modified` header with a timestamp indicating when the script was built and deployed.

#### Errors

Failure will return JSON to inform you that something's not `ok` and a `message` as to why.

```json
{
    "ok": false,
    "message": "It went kaput üí©"
}
```

### Good to Know
Send a `GET` request to act as a little health-check. Response `204` means you're good to go. Useful for testing CORS configuration üëç
